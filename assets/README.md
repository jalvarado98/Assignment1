# Portfolio
My motivation for this project was to demonstrate the skills I learned in class and it was a personal test to see if I am actually dedicating my time into this class.
What I built was a website and although it might not be designed that well, I did end up learning a lot when it comes to floating, css, html, and columns.
I hope to perfect this site and develop more.
